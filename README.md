## Overview

This project is an experimental C language program that plays simple sounds using Nuked-OPM (a Yamaha YM2151 emulator). It uses zig cc for building.

## Features

- ✅ Accurate YM2151 emulation using the Nuked-OPM library
- ✅ Windows build using zig cc
- ✅ WAV file output functionality (src/phase2/)
- ✅ Real-time audio playback functionality (src/phase3/)
- ✅ Simple sequencer functionality (src/phase4/)
- ✅ Provides an easy way to experience YM2151 sounds on Windows
- ✅ Simple code that might be easy to reference

## Build

```powershell
python build.py build-phase4 && ./player.exe
```

## Future Plans

- Consider corrections if there are any obvious deficiencies in the code, comments, or documentation.

## Out of Scope

This project prioritizes code simplicity; therefore, features that would complicate the code, such as those listed below, are out of scope.

- Any feature additions that increase code complexity, including improving generality for direct library referencing
- Interactive performance
- Reproduction of clock and timing as if played on an X680x0
- Reproduction of existing songs
